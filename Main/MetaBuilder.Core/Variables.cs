//In .Net 2.0 Settings(.settings) should be used to provide a read/write way of storing custom config data. 
//The actual settings are scoped to the current user and are stored within "documents and settings", 
//though this is completely transparent to the application. This way the application never needs to 
//physically write to the directory where the application is actually running.

////Deploy your app.config file to the same directory as your application as normal. (THIS IS WHAT WE DO)
////You don't need elevation to read from the configuration file, only if you are writting (in which case use settings).

//Level	Description
//asInvoker	Does not require elevation, runs without requesting elevation using privileges of its parent process.
//highestAvailable	Requests the highest available privilege tokens of its parent process. An administrator account will attempt to elevate to full administrator level, but a standard account will only request elevation to its own highest set of access tokens.
//requireAdministrator	Requires elevation to full administrator privileges.
