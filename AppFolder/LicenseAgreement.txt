1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS: Use of SOFTWARE constitutes acceptance 
of the terms of this Agreement.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE: DISCON Specialists (Licensor) grants to 
the purchaser of the MetaBuilder Software (Licensee), a 
Non Exclusive License to use the contents, MetaBuilder ( SOFTWARE ),

DISCON Specialists reserves all rights not 
expressly granted to the Licensee in this agreement. 

3. LIMITATIONS ON REVERSE ENGINEERING, DECOMPILATION, AND DISASSEMBLY. 
You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, 
except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly 
permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation.

4. COPYRIGHT: The SOFTWARE is owned by Licensor and is protected 
by the United States copyright laws and international treaty 
provisions. Therefore, Licensee must treat the SOFTWARE like any 
other copyright material (e.g. a book or musical recording) except 
that Licensee may (a) make a copy for back up purposes, and (b) 
transfer the software to a single hard disk for the purpose of 
system installation. Licensee may not copy written material 
accompanying the SOFTWARE. Violation of United States copyright 
law and/or international treaty provisions may result in both 
Civil and Criminal penalties. 

5. TRANSFER OF LICENSE: Licensee may NOT transfer any rights 
granted under this License to any third party.

6. LIMIT OF LIABILITY: Licensor will not be liable to Licensee or 
any other user of this SOFTWARE for any damages, including but not 
limited to, lost profits or lost savings as a result of Licensee's 
or any other user's use of Licensor's SOFTWARE.

Because some States do not allow the exclusion or limitation of 
liability for some damages, the above limitation may not apply.
